## Module 3 Authorship & Review
**FAQs:**
1. What's typically the biggest issue FDA finds in Module 3?
   - Inadequate justification of specifications. The FDA wants to see how you arrived at your acceptance criteria—not just the number, but the rationale. If your impurity limit is 0.5%, you need data showing this is safe and achievable. We ensure every spec has a clear link to safety, efficacy, and manufacturing capability.

2. How detailed should my manufacturing description be?
   - Detailed enough that inspectors can verify what you've written matches what they see at your facility. You don't need to reveal proprietary processes in excruciating detail, but you must describe critical steps, parameters, and controls. We strike the balance between transparency and IP protection.

3. Do I need analytical validation data in Module 3?
   - Yes. Module 3.2.S.4 and 3.2.P.5 require method validation summaries demonstrating that your analytical methods are suitable. Full validation reports go in Module 3.2.P.5.3 or regional modules.We organize your analytical package to streamline reviewer assessment.

4. What's the difference between Module 2.3 (QOS) and Module 3?
   - Module 2.3 is the executive summary of your quality data, written for reviewers who aren't CMC specialists. Module 3 is the detailed technical data package. Think of 2.3 as the "highlights reel" and Module 3 as the complete game footage. Both must tell the same story.

5. How often do CMC deficiencies delay approval?
   - More often than you'd think. CDER data shows CMC issues are among the top reasons for RTF (Refuse to File) and Complete Response Letters. A well-written Module 3 prevents these delays. We've never had a client receive RTF due to Module 3 deficiencies.

6. Can I use a CMC submittal for multiple regions?
   - Yes, with modifications. The CTD format (Modules 1-5) is harmonized across ICH regions, but each region has specific requirements—the EU wants a plasma master file (PMF) for biologics, Japan may need additional stability data. We create a core dossier you can adapt regionally.

**Regulatory Guidance:**
- ICH M4Q: Quality - The Common Technical Document
- FDA Guidance: CTD Module 3 - Quality
- EMA Guideline: CTD Quality

**Testimonial:**
"Our Module 3 was scrutinized heavily during review, but Adelphi's documentation was so thorough that we received zero CMC-related information requests. The reviewers even complimented our clarity." - Jennifer Liu, VP Quality, Mid-Size Biotech

## GMP Compliance Audits
**FAQs:**
1. What's the difference between a PAI and a routine GMP inspection?
   - A Pre-Approval Inspection (PAI) happens before drug approval to verify your manufacturing is consistent with your application. They're intense, focused audits. Routine inspections happen periodically after approval. PAIs have higher stakes—deficiencies can delay or even derail approval.

2. How should I prepare for an FDA inspection?
   - Start 6-12 months early. Conduct mock inspections, ensure your data integrity controls are bulletproof, train your team on interview techniques, and organize your document repository. The FDA can show up unannounced for cause, but PAIs are scheduled. We run realistic mock inspections that mirror FDA behavior.

3. What are the most common Form 483 observations?
   - Data integrity issues (ALCOA+ principles), inadequate investigations of deviations, insufficient cleaning validation, and procedural gaps. Many stem from documentation—either incomplete or inconsistent. Our audits identify these before the FDA does.

4. Can supplier issues affect my approval?
   - Absolutely. If your API supplier or critical raw material vendor has quality issues, it's your problem. The FDA expects you to qualify and monitor suppliers rigorously. We conduct supplier audits to ensure they won't become your liability.

5. What's data integrity and why is the FDA obsessed with it?
   - Data integrity means your data is Attributable, Legible, Contemporaneous, Original, and Accurate (ALCOA). Modern guidance adds (+) Complete, Consistent, Enduring, and Available. The FDA has seen too many cases of data manipulation. Expect intense scrutiny of electronic records, audit trails, and lab notebooks.

6. How long does an FDA inspection typically last?
   - PAIs typically run 3-5 days for small molecules, up to a week or more for biologics or complex manufacturing. Routine inspections are similar. Every day matters—a well-prepared team can make the difference between "no observations" and a Warning Letter.

**Regulatory Guidance:**
- FDA Guidance: Data Integrity and Compliance with Drug CGMP
- ICH Q10: Pharmaceutical Quality System
- FDA Guidance: Process Validation

**Testimonial:**
"The mock inspection Adelphi ran was tougher than the real FDA PAI. When inspectors arrived, our team was ready. No Form 483." - Mark Stevens, QA Director

## 21 CFR Part 11 Compliance
**FAQs:**
1. What systems need to be Part 11 compliant?
   - Any electronic system used to create, modify, maintain, or transmit records required by other FDA regulations. This includes LIMS, ERP systems, electronic batch records, analytical instruments with data output, and stability chambers. If it touches GMP data, it likely needs Part 11 controls.

2. What's the difference between Part 11 compliance and data integrity?
   - Part 11 is the specific US regulation governing electronic records and signatures. Data integrity is the broader concept (global) ensuring your data is trustworthy. Part 11 is a subset of data integrity focused on US GMP requirements. Good data integrity practices generally satisfy Part 11.

3. Do I need to validate every software update?
   - Not necessarily. The FDA distinguishes between software validation (ensuring it does what it's supposed to) and change control (managing updates). Minor patches may only need impact assessment and testing. Major version upgrades typically require revalidation. We help you risk-assess each change.

4. Can I use cloud-based systems for GMP data?
   - Yes, but with caveats. The FDA accepts cloud systems if you can demonstrate data security, backup procedures, audit trails, and the ability to retrieve data for inspection. You retain ultimate responsibility even if the vendor hosts the data. We help structure vendor agreements to ensure compliance.

5. What are the biggest Part 11 violations companies make?
   - Shared logins (violates authentication requirements), inadequate audit trails (no record of who changed what and when), lack of system validation documentation, and insufficient training. Many of these are easy fixes if caught early.

6. How do I demonstrate compliance during an inspection?
   - Be ready to show: system validation documentation, SOPs for electronic record management, audit trail reports, training records, and evidence of periodic review. Inspectors will often ask to see "who changed this batch record and when?" Your system better have an answer.

**Regulatory Guidance:**
- FDA: 21 CFR Part 11 - Electronic Records and Electronic Signatures
- FDA Guidance: Data Integrity and Compliance with Drug CGMP
- GAMP 5: Good Automated Manufacturing Practice

**Testimonial:**
"We thought our Part 11 controls were solid until Adelphi's audit revealed gaps we hadn't considered. Fixing them before our PAI was a lifesaver." - Dr. Anita Patel, VP Quality

## Stability Data Assessment
**FAQs:**
1. How much stability data do I need to file an NDA?
   - For commercial batches: at least 12 months of long-term stability data at commercial scale (ICH Q1A). You can file with 6 months if you commit to continue testing and submit annual updates. For registration batches, 12 months is the minimum for most regions. We help design protocols that satisfy all regions simultaneously.

2. What's the difference between real-time and accelerated stability?
   - Real-time stability is conducted at your proposed storage condition (e.g., 25°C/60% RH for room temperature storage). Accelerated stability uses elevated stress conditions (e.g., 40°C/75% RH) to predict long-term behavior quickly. Both are required—real-time supports your shelf life claim, accelerated identifies degradation pathways early.

3. Can I extrapolate shelf life beyond my actual data?
   - To some extent. If you have 12 months of data and a linear degradation trend, you might support an 18-month shelf life with a commitment to continue testing. The FDA rarely grants more than 2x your actual data. Extrapolation is a negotiation point—we help make the statistical case.

4. What happens if a stability batch fails specifications?
   - First, investigate. Is it real degradation or an analytical artifact? If real, you may need to reduce your shelf life claim, revise specifications, or implement additional controls. Depending on timing, this can delay approval. We build contingency plans into stability protocols.

5. Do I need stability data from my commercial manufacturer?
   - Yes. Registration stability should ideally be from the to-be-marketed site. If you're switching manufacturers post-approval, you'll need comparability data and bridging stability from the new site. The FDA wants assurance that the product they approved is what patients will receive.

6. How often do I test after approval?
   - Confirmed shelf life requires annual stability testing on at least one commercial batch per year (more if you have multiple strengths or presentations). This is an ongoing commitment. If you slack off, inspectors will notice and your shelf life could be questioned.

**Regulatory Guidance:**
- ICH Q1A: Stability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products
- ICH Q1E: Evaluation of Stability Data
- FDA Guidance: Expiration Dating and Stability Testing

**Testimonial:**
"Our stability protocol was overly complex and inefficient. Adelphi redesigned it to meet all regional requirements with 40% fewer timepoints. Smart science, better economics." - Tom Richardson, CMC Lead

## Impurity Qualification
**FAQs:**
1. What's the difference between identification, qualification, and specification?
   - Identification means you know the structure of an impurity. Qualification means you've evaluated its safety (toxicology if needed). Specification is the acceptance limit you set. You must identify/qualify any impurity above ICH thresholds before commercializing.

2. At what level do I need to qualify impurities?
   - Per ICH Q3A/Q3B: ≥0.1% for drug substance, ≥0.1% for drug product (or even lower for very high doses). Below these thresholds, identification/qualification may not be needed. Above them, you need a safety rationale—either tox studies or scientific justification.

3. Can I use literature data to qualify an impurity?
   - Sometimes. If your impurity is a known compound with published safety data (e.g., a USP degradant or a metabolite), you can reference that literature rather than conducting new animal studies. We're experts at finding and leveraging existing data to avoid costly tox studies.

4. What if an impurity shows up late in development?
   - If it's a new impurity not seen in clinical batches, it's a problem. You'll need to either demonstrate it's safe (qualification), prove it was below detection limits earlier (not truly "new"), or revise your manufacturing process to control it. Late-stage impurity issues delay filings.

5. How does the FDA view process-related impurities vs. degradants?
   - Process-related impurities (from synthesis) are controlled through manufacturing. Degradants (formed over time) are controlled through formulation and packaging. Both need qualification if above thresholds, but degradants also drive your stability program. We integrate impurity control into both process design and stability strategy.

6. Do I need to test for mutagenic impurities?
   - Yes, per ICH M7. Certain chemical classes (e.g., alkyl halides, nitrosamines) have mutagenic potential. Even if you don't detect them, you must perform a risk assessment and have a control strategy. Recently, nitrosamine impurities have caused major product recalls. We conduct ICH M7 assessments proactively.

**Regulatory Guidance:**
- ICH Q3A: Impurities in New Drug Substances
- ICH Q3B: Impurities in New Drug Products
- ICH M7: Assessment and Control of DNA Reactive (Mutagenic) Impurities

**Testimonial:**
"An unexpected impurity appeared in our pivotal batches at 0.12%. Adelphi found published safety data that qualified it without delaying our NDA. That saved us 6 months and $500K in tox studies." - Dr. Lisa Park, Development Chemist
